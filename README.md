## Content
### Ballotpedia Webscraper
Contains an R file that scrapes webpages for each of the 435 US House of Representative races in 2022. Only candidates that are listed on Ballotpedia are included, therefore, the data may not encompass all candidates. The webscraper gives the name of the candidate, their party, the district they are running for, a link to their individual candidate page on Ballotpedia, a link to their campaign website, as well as their Twitter account handles (Official, Personal, and Campaign accounts)

The folder also contains the output of webscraper as an Excel sheet for anyone who would like to use the data. This file was last updated on: Oct 21st, 2021.
